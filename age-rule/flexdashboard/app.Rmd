Large age disparities within dating relationships carry certain stigmas. One popular rule of thumb is the [half-your-age-plus-seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#The_.22half-your-age-plus-seven.22_rule) rule. This rule states you should never date anyone under half your age plus seven, establishing a minimum boundary on whom one can date. In order for a dating relationship to be acceptable under this rule, your partner's age must be:

$$\frac{\text{Your age}}{2} + 7 < \text{Partner Age} < (\text{Your age} - 7) * 2$$

```{r}
numericInput("age_you",
                    "Your age:",
                    min = age_min_data,
                    max = age_max_data,
                    value = 25)

numericInput("age_partner",
                    "Partner's age:",
                    min = age_min_data,
                    max = age_max_data,
                    value = 25)
